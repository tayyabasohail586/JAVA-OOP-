Project on Hospital Management System
This is a simple Hospital Management System developed in Java using Swing for the graphical user interface. It demonstrates core object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism through the implementation of different roles—Doctor, Nurse, and Patient—each with their own properties and behaviors. Users can add records for each type, view all stored data in a scrollable window, and interact with the application through button-driven input dialogs. The system calculates salaries for doctors and nurses based on their respective criteria and provides a clear, organized structure that's easy to extend or enhance. This project is ideal for beginners looking to understand how to build desktop applications in Java with clean OOP design.
